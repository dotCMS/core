For now it uses a plain list of observable\n * callbacks.\n *\n * # Example:\n *\n * Assume that `<tabs>` component would like to get a list its children which are `<pane>` components as shown in this\n * example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <tabs>\n *   <pane title=\"Overview\">...</pane>\n *   <pane *for=\"#o of objects\" [title]=\"o.title\">{{o.text}}</pane>\n * </tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * In the above example the list of `<tabs>` elements needs to get a list of `<pane>` elements so that it could render\n * tabs with the correct titles and in the correct order.\n *\n * A possible solution would be for a `<pane>` to inject `<tabs>` component and then register itself with `<tabs>`\n * component's on `hydrate` and deregister on `dehydrate` event. While a reasonable approach, this would only work\n * partialy since `*for` could rearange the list of `<pane>` components which would not be reported to `<tabs>`\n * component and thus the list of `<pane>` componets would be out of sync with respect to the list of `<pane>` elements.\n *\n * A preferred solution is to inject a `QueryList` which is a live list of directives in the component`s light DOM.\n *\n * ```javascript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'tabs'\n * })\n * @View({\n *  template: `\n *    <ul>\n *      <li *for=\"#pane of panes\">{{pane.title}}</li>\n *    </ul>\n *    <content></content>\n *  `\n * })\n * class Tabs {\n *   panes: QueryList<Pane>\n *\n *   constructor(@Query(Pane) panes:QueryList<Pane>) {\n *     this.panes = panes;\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'pane',\n *   properties: ['title']\n * })\n * @View(...)\n * class Pane {\n *   title:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @exportedAs angular2/view\n */\nexport class QueryList extends BaseQueryList {\n\n  /**\n   */\n  onChange(callback) {\n    return super.onChange(callback);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   */\n  removeCallback(callback) {\n    return super.removeCallback(callback);\n  }\n\n}\n"]}
