The scripts in this directory are responsible for generating the data tables in dojo/cldr/nls.
Dojo provides a subset of this output in dojo/cldr/nls under source control, the rest must be
generated by the developer using these scripts.  See dojo/cldr/README for details.

To trigger generation of a full set of locale resources, simply type "ant".  An optional
list of locales may be specified as an ant property to limit the set of locales built.
Currencies may also be specified, but a default list is included in the ant script.

NOTE: it is currently necessary to perform a one-time installation of the Saxon XSLT 
  processor in ~/.ant/lib due to classpath issues and workarounds.  The ant task will do this for you.
  
  Also, ant version 1.6.5 is recommended with Java 1.5.  The build script does not properly resolve the
  XSLT catalog with newer versions of ant which makes the process take much longer.  See ticket #7969
