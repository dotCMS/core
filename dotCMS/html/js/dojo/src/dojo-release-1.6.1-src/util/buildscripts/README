The util/buildscripts directory allows you do to custom builds of the dojo source.

REQUIREMENTS
=======================
The build system requires that Java 1.4.2 or later is installed.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
=======================
Recommended directory structure and names (if using dijit and dojox in addition to
dojo core):

- dijit
- dojo
- dojox
- util
  - buildscripts

Builds will be generated in a "release" directory that is a sibling to util
(the output directory will also be printed at the end of the build).
  
DOING A BUILD
=======================
In the util/buildscripts directory, to run the the build, type the following:

Windows-based operating systems:
> build.bat

All other operating systems:
> build.sh
(may need to chmod +x build.sh to get it to execute as a script)

Typing the above command will give you some help text with the allowed build
options.

TYPICAL BUILDS
=======================
This command will use the build profile at util/buildscripts/profiles/standard.profile.js
to do a build:

> build.sh profile=standard action=release

To do an xdomain build, add the loader argument:

> build.sh profile=standard loader=xdomain action=release
