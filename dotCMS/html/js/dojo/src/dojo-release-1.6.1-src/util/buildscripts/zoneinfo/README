Use these files and scripts to generate the zoneinfo files in dojox/date/zoneinfo

In the tzdata folder are the olson zoneinfo files as distributed.  Only the following
files are needed from this archive:
	africa, antarctica, asia, australasia, backward, etcetera, europe,
	northamerica, pacificnew, southamerica
	
The strip_olson_comments.rb script can be used to pull out unneeded comment lines
from the files - thus making them smaller
