Drupal
======

Prerequisites
=============

PHP5
See: Installing Libraries (below)

Installing Drupal
=================

http://drupal.org/drupal-5.7 (tested on 5.7 at the time of this writing)
http://drupal.org/getting-started/5/install

Installing Libraries
====================

Read the EXTERNALS file in jsdoc/lib

Installing the Module
=====================

http://drupal.org/node/70151
Drop the jsdoc folder into sites/all/modules

Enable the Module
=================

Enable in: Administer->Site building->Modules

Configure
=========

* Make sure that PHP has write persmissions to the util/jsdoc/cache directory
* Fill in the configuration in: Administer->Site configuration->JavaScript Documentation
** Under "Directory to run your file from",
   enter the FULL PATH to util/docscripts (eg /var/www/dojotoolkit/util/docscripts)
** Under "Location of file used to parse your code",
   enter the FULL PATH to util/docscripts/includes/dojo.inc
   (eg /var/www/dojotoolkit/util/docscripts/includes/dojo.inc)
** Under  "This will be used as a base of our functions", enter "dojo"
* If you want to add a new namespace, see the plugins in util/docscripts/modules
  (dojox.module is probably the easiest to copy).
  Function names should begin with the file name prefix of the module file
  eg dojo.module's functions start with "dojo".
* Remove (or change the file type) of these modules to exclude them from
  processing.

Run Cron
========

In the base of your Drupal folder, you'll see cron.php. This has a 30s processing limit,
so you'll need to run it until your DB is fully populated. Run either in your browser
or with cron and a wget/curl command.
