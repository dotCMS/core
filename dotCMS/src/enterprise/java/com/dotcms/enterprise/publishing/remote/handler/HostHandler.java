/**
 * This handler class is part of the Push Publishing mechanism that deals with Site-related information inside a bundle
 * and saves it in the receiving instance. This class will read and process only the {@link com.dotmarketing.beans.Host}
 * data files. Keep in mind that Sites are objects of type
 * {@link com.dotmarketing.portlets.contentlet.model.Contentlet},
 * so they're handled and saved via the {@link ContentHandler}.
 * <p>
 * dotCMS supports the addition multiple Sites that can all share the same templates, containers, files, and content as
 * needed. You can create as many Sites as your server/network hardware specifications will allow. The Site addresses
 * will, of course, need to be configured/maintained in the DNS records of your organization by a system administrator.
