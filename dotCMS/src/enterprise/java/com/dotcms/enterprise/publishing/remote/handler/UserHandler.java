/**
 * This handler class is part of the Push Publishing mechanism that deals with User-related information inside a
 * bundle and saves it in the receiving instance. This class will read and process only the {@link User} data files.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of user logins in dotCMS: front-end and back-end. Front end user accounts give access to
 * restricted content and/or restricted sections of the front-end (public facing portion) of your site - very much like
 * a traditional account login system used at many other sites. Back-end users are users who are able to login into the
 * dotCMS back-end console. Back-end users are extended Permissions which give them access to tools used to add and
 * modify content or otherwise change your site (as their permissions allow).
