# REST endpoits documentation

With the attached collections you can generate the REST documentation to know how works each of the endpoints and generate the curl commands in order to use them.

### *__How to generate__*
1. Install the postman app in your local machine 
2. Once you have installed postman locally, open the app and click to import button (is on the top of the window. [Image](https://screencast.com/t/KO9OM9YaeQ))
3. Select documentation collection json file. [Image](https://screencast.com/t/pCO3B1Fkk)
4. Once you have the set of test imported, go to the collection options and click on **"View in web"** button. [Image](https://screencast.com/t/JcsPZ6ojRv8V)

This will redirect to a page with the documentation, here you can see every curl command in order to use each endpoint. As you can see in this example: https://goo.gl/qa251o
