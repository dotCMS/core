/**
 * This Finder Strategy allows developers to correctly determine the best way of retrieving information about how a
 * given Container can be related to one or more Content Types in dotCMS. There are different ways of creating
 * Containers in the system. For example:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Default Containers -- added via the <b>Containers</b> portlet in the back-end.</li>
 *    <li>Containers as Files.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>This means that the metadata for each of them comes from different data sources. In that case, specific strategies
 * must be implemented in order to correctly validate and retrieve such information so that dotCMS can seamlessly work
 * with Containers, regardless the approach that Developers or Content Authors followed to create them.
