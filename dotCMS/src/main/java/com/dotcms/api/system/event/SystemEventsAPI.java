/**
 * This API allows users and other services to record and retrieve different
 * types of events that dotCMS and custom services (specially UI components) can
 * react to. For example, system events can be:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An entry in the Notifications component.</li>
 * <li>A contentlet that has been added to or deleted from the system which will
 * display a message on screen.</li>
 * <li>A message indicating that the enterprise license is about to expire.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The idea behind the System Events API is to provide message queue that
 * services can read at specific moments in time, which are not limited to
 * simple notifications. For example, existing features such as the Site Browser
 * or the Publishing Queue can react to incoming notifications and display
 * information to the user, or even refresh their content to reflect new
 * changes.
 * <p>
 * For practical examples, a Quartz job can be constantly monitoring system
 * events added to the internal message queue and trigger a process based on
 * their information or payload.
