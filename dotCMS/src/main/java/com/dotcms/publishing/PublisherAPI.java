/**
 * This API allows the Push Publishing mechanism in dotCMS to generate a bundle with the list of objects specified by
 * the User and potential dependent data. Such a bundle will be either pushed to another dotCMS instance, or will be
 * available for download via the back-end.
 * <p>This API also allows users to choose Push Publishing Filters when sending data. These filters control which
 * content is pushed from your sending server to your receiving server. The filters allow you to have fine-grained
 * control over what content does and does not get pushed, whether intentionally (when specifically selected) or by
 * dependency.</p>
 * <p>Bundles allow you to add and group multiple types of content (the same content items you can individually Push)
 * for later use. For instance, it is possible to create a Bundle with Folders, Pages, and content assets, and after
 * changing each of the bundled items you can remote Push the whole Bundle instead of having to push each of the
 * individual content items separately.</p>
