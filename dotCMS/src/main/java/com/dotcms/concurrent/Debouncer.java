/**
 * This class implements a debouncer, which is intended to prevent multiple calls to a single method
 * within a set peroid of time. Debouncing ensures that a method doesnâ€™t get called too frequently,
 * but does get called when needed. This is important when trying to prevent run away calls to a
 * particularly expensiveMethod() - for example, calls to flush and rebuild cache, that happen in
 * response to user input or system actions. It allows us to call expensiveMethod() in code 1, 10 or 100
 * times, as many times as needed with confidence that finally, expensiveMethod() will only be called
 * once, after the final call to expensiveMethod() has been made.
 * 
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 * final Debouncer debouncer = new Debouncer(); 
 * debouncer.debounce("myRunnableKey",()->{runnable..}, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
 *
