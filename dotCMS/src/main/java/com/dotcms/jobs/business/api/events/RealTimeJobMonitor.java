/**
 * Manages real-time monitoring of jobs in the system. This class provides functionality to register
 * watchers for specific jobs and receive notifications about job state changes and progress updates.
 *
 * <p>Thread safety is ensured through a combination of {@link ConcurrentHashMap} for storing watchers
 * and synchronized {@link List}s for managing multiple watchers per job. This allows concurrent
 * registration and notification of watchers without compromising data consistency.</p>
 *
 * <p>The monitor supports filtered watching through predicates, allowing clients to receive only
 * the updates they're interested in. Common predicates are provided through the inner
 * {@link Predicates} class.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Examples:</h2>
 *
 * <p>Watch all job updates:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * monitor.registerWatcher(jobId, job -> System.out.println("Job updated: " + job.id()));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Watch only completed jobs:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * monitor.registerWatcher(jobId,
 *     job -> handleCompletion(job),
 *     Predicates.isCompleted()
 * );
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Watch progress changes with threshold:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * monitor.registerWatcher(jobId,
 *     job -> updateProgress(job),
 *     Predicates.progressChanged(0.1f) // Updates every 10% progress
 * );
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Combine multiple conditions:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * monitor.registerWatcher(jobId,
 *     job -> handleUpdate(job),
 *     Predicates.hasState(JobState.RUNNING)
 *         .and(Predicates.progressChanged(0.05f))
 * );
 * }</pre>
