          | Property | Type | Description |
          |-|-|-|
          | `query` | String | A Lucene query that can target multiple contentlets for editing. Example: `+contentType:htmlpageasset` for all dotCMS pages. |
          | `contentlet` | Object | An alternate way of specifying the target contentlet. If no identifier or inode is included via parameter, either one could instead be included in the body as a property of this object. |
          | `comments` | String | Comments that will appear in the [workflow tasks](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/workflow-tasks) tool with the execution of this workflow action. |
          | `individualPermissions` | Object | Allows setting granular permissions associated with the target. The object properties are the [system names of permissions](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/user-permissions#Permissions), such as READ, PUBLISH, EDIT, etc. Their respective values are a list of user or role identifiers that should be granted the permission in question. Example: `"READ": ["9ad24203-ae6a-4e5e-aa10-a8c38fd11f17","MyRole"]` |
          | `assign` | String | The identifier of a user or role to next receive the workflow task assignment. |
          | `pathToMove` | String | If the workflow action includes the Move actionlet, this property will specify the target path. This path must include a host, such as `//default/testfolder`, `//demo.dotcms.com/application`, etc. |
          | `whereToSend` | String | For the [push publishing](push-publishing) actionlet; sets the push-publishing environment to receive the target content. Must be specified as an environment identifier. [Learn how to find environment IDs here.](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/push-publishing-endpoints#EnvironmentIds) |
          | `iWantTo` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; this can be set to one of three values: <ul style="line-height:2rem;"><li>`publish` for push publish;</li><li>`expire` for remove;</li><li>`publishexpire` for push remove.</li></ul> These are further configurable with the properties below that specify publishing and expiration dates, times, etc. |
          | `publishDate` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a date to push the content. Format: `yyyy-MM-dd`.  |
          | `publishTime` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a time to push the content. Format: `hh-mm`. |
          | `expireDate` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a date to remove the content. Format: `yyyy-MM-dd`.  |
          | `expireTime` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a time to remove the content. Format: `hh-mm`.  |
          | `neverExpire` | Boolean | For the push publishing actionlet; a value of `true` invalidates the expiration time/date. |
          | `filterKey` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a [push publishing filter](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/push-publishing-filters) key, should the workflow action call for such. To retrieve a full list of push publishing filters and their keys, use `GET /v1/pushpublish/filters`. |
          | `timezoneId` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies the time zone to which the indicated times belong. Uses the [tz database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). For a list of values, see [the database directly](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html) or refer to [the Wikipedia entry listing tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). |

          Body consists of a JSON object containing at minimum the `actionName` property, specifying a workflow action to fire.

          The full list of properties that may be used with this form is as follows:

          | Property | Type | Description |
          |-|-|-|
          | `actionName` | String | The name of the workflow action to perform. |
          | `contentlet` | Object | An alternate way of specifying the target contentlet. If no identifier or inode is included via parameter, either one could instead be included in the body as a property of this object. |
          | `comments` | String | Comments that will appear in the [workflow tasks](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/workflow-tasks) tool with the execution of this workflow action. |
          | `individualPermissions` | Object | Allows setting granular permissions associated with the target. The object properties are the [system names of permissions](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/user-permissions#Permissions), such as READ, PUBLISH, EDIT, etc. Their respective values are a list of user or role identifiers that should be granted the permission in question. Example: `"READ": ["9ad24203-ae6a-4e5e-aa10-a8c38fd11f17","MyRole"]` |
          | `assign` | String | The identifier of a user or role to next receive the workflow task assignment. |
          | `pathToMove` | String | If the workflow action includes the Move actionlet, this property will specify the target path. This path must include a host, such as `//default/testfolder`, `//demo.dotcms.com/application`, etc. |
          | `query` | String | Not used in this method. |
          | `whereToSend` | String | For the [push publishing](push-publishing) actionlet; sets the push-publishing environment to receive the target content. Must be specified as an environment identifier. [Learn how to find environment IDs here.](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/push-publishing-endpoints#EnvironmentIds) |
          | `iWantTo` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; this can be set to one of three values: <ul style="line-height:2rem;"><li>`publish` for push publish;</li><li>`expire` for remove;</li><li>`publishexpire` for push remove.</li></ul> These are further configurable with the properties below that specify publishing and expiration dates, times, etc. |
          | `publishDate` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a date to push the content. Format: `yyyy-MM-dd`.  |
          | `publishTime` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a time to push the content. Format: `hh-mm`. |
          | `expireDate` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a date to remove the content. Format: `yyyy-MM-dd`.  |
          | `expireTime` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a time to remove the content. Format: `hh-mm`.  |
          | `neverExpire` | Boolean | For the push publishing actionlet; a value of `true` invalidates the expiration time/date. |
          | `filterKey` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a [push publishing filter](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/push-publishing-filters) key, should the workflow action call for such. To retrieve a full list of push publishing filters and their keys, use `GET /v1/pushpublish/filters`. |

          Optional body consists of a JSON object containing various properties, some of which are specific to certain actionlets.

          The full list of properties that may be used with this form is as follows:

          | Property | Type | Description |
          |-|-|-|
          | `contentlet` | Object | An alternate way of specifying the target contentlet. If no identifier or inode is included via parameter, either one could instead be included in the body as a property of this object. |
          | `comments` | String | Comments that will appear in the [workflow tasks](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/workflow-tasks) tool with the execution of this workflow action. |
          | `individualPermissions` | Object | Allows setting granular permissions associated with the target. The object properties are the [system names of permissions](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/user-permissions#Permissions), such as READ, PUBLISH, EDIT, etc. Their respective values are a list of user or role identifiers that should be granted the permission in question. Example: `"READ": ["9ad24203-ae6a-4e5e-aa10-a8c38fd11f17","MyRole"]` |
          | `assign` | String | The identifier of a user or role to next receive the workflow task assignment. |
          | `pathToMove` | String | If the workflow action includes the Move actionlet, this property will specify the target path. This path must include a host, such as `//default/testfolder`, `//demo.dotcms.com/application`, etc. |
          | `query` | String | Not used in this method. |
          | `whereToSend` | String | For the [push publishing](push-publishing) actionlet; sets the push-publishing environment to receive the target content. Must be specified as an environment identifier. [Learn how to find environment IDs here.](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/push-publishing-endpoints#EnvironmentIds) |
          | `iWantTo` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; this can be set to one of three values: <ul style="line-height:2rem;"><li>`publish` for push publish;</li><li>`expire` for remove;</li><li>`publishexpire` for push remove.</li></ul> These are further configurable with the properties below that specify publishing and expiration dates, times, etc. |
          | `publishDate` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a date to push the content. Format: `yyyy-MM-dd`.  |
          | `publishTime` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a time to push the content. Format: `hh-mm`. |
          | `expireDate` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a date to remove the content. Format: `yyyy-MM-dd`.  |
          | `expireTime` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a time to remove the content. Format: `hh-mm`.  |
          | `neverExpire` | Boolean | For the push publishing actionlet; a value of `true` invalidates the expiration time/date. |
          | `filterKey` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies a [push publishing filter](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/push-publishing-filters) key, should the workflow action call for such. To retrieve a full list of push publishing filters and their keys, use `GET /v1/pushpublish/filters`. |
          | `timezoneId` | String | For the push publishing actionlet; specifies the time zone to which the indicated times belong. Uses the [tz database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). For a list of values, see [the database directly](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html) or refer to [the Wikipedia entry listing tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). |

          | `schemeId` | String | The identifier of a workflow scheme to be associated with the system action. |
          | `contentTypeVariable` | String | The variable of a content type to be associated with the system action. Note that the content type must already have the schema assigned as one of its valid workflows in order to bind a system action from said schema. |

          If both the `schemeId` and `contentTypeVariable` are specified, the scheme identifier takes precedence, and the content type variable is disregarded.

        Deletes a [default system action](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/managing-workflows#DefaultActions) binding.

        Returns the deleted system action object.

        This method is minimally destructive, as it neither deletes a [workflow action](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/managing-workflows#Actions), nor removes any system action category. Instead, it dissolves the association between the two, which can be re-established any time.

        To find a suitable identifier, you can use `GET /system/actions/{workflowActionId}` and find it in the immediate `identifier` property of any of the objects returned in the entity.
