Dojo Mobile Themes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dojo provides platform-specific themes for Android 2, Android 3/4, iOS and Blackberry. There is also a generic theme named "custom".  

All themes are generated using the Less CSS library (http://lesscss.org/).

Building mobile themes
----------------------

1. Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org/). 

2. Run compile.bat or compile.sh to generate all themes.

You can also run cleanup.bat or cleanup.sh to remove all the generated css files.  


Creating a new theme from the Custom theme
------------------------------------------     

The 'custom' theme (i.e. mobile/themes/custom folder) is a generic grey theme. It is a good starting point for creating a new theme. All colors of this theme are derived from 2 colors defined at the beginning of themes/custom/variables.less.

To create a new theme, you can change these colors (i.e. @lightColor and @darkColor) as well as other part of variables.less and then run the compile script.
