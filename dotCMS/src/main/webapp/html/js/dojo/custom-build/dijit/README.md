# dijit

**dijit** is the package that contains the widget library for Dojo Toolkit.  It requires the [core][] of the Dojo
Toolkit and provides a framework for building additional widgets as well as a full set of rich user interface widgets
including form, layout and data-aware items.

While still being maintained, new development is primarily focused on modern Dojo.
