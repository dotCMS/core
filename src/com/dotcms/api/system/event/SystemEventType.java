/**
 * A System Event can be generated for a variety of reasons, such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A notification for the user.</li>
 * <li>An error during the execution of a scheduled job.</li>
 * <li>The login of a specific user.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The idea behind this class is to map a type of event with different possible
 * scenarios that developers or third-party systems would create System Events
 * for. This way, client-side code can handle specific types of system events
 * and make dotCMS react accordingly.
