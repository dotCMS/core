# dotCMS CLI 
The **dotCMS CLI**, sometimes shortened to **dotCLI**, is a standalone tool for interacting with a dotCMS instance through a command shell, allowing a wide array of automated operations and behaviors.

## Getting Started

### Installation

### NPM

The simplest and most recommended way to get the dotCMS CLI is from its npm package:

```shell script
npm install -g @dotcms/cli
```
### Manual JAR Download

1. Download the CLI: The dotCMS CLI is delivered as an uber jar that can be downloaded from [here](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-snapshot-local/com/dotcms/dotcms-cli/).
 Once downloaded, you just need to run it with: 

```shell script
java -jar dotcli.jar
```

2. Configure the dotCMS instances you want to connect to using a dot-service.yml file. More details on how to do it [on this section](## CLI Instance Configuration). Make sure you make a site active in the yml file, otherwise you will have to active one using the [`instance` command](## Available Commands)

3. Log in to the selected instance
```shell script
java -jar dotcli.jar login --user={USER} --password  
```

You can find more details about how to use the dotCMS CLI in the [Examples](#examples) section.



## Examples

1. Log in with an admin user
```shell script
login --user=admin@dotCMS.com --password
```
2. List and choose the dotCMS instance we want to run against
```shell script
instance --list
```
3. Activate a dotCMS instance profile called `demo`
```shell script
instance --activate demo
```
4. Get info of the current instance running
```shell

status
	
#You will get an output similar to:
2023-02-22 11:25:29,499 INFO  [com.dot.api.cli.HybridServiceManagerImpl] (Quarkus Main Thread) Service [default] is missing credentials.
2023-02-22 11:25:29,500 INFO  [com.dot.api.cli.HybridServiceManagerImpl] (Quarkus Main Thread) Service [demo] is missing credentials.
Active instance is [demo] API is [https://demo.dotcms.com/api] No active user Use login Command.
```

5. Pull a content type
```shell script
content-type pull FileAsset
```
6. Create a new site
```shell script
site create "my.cool.bikes.site.com"
```

## Building the CLI (dev mode)

The CLI is a quarkus/pico-cli project made up of two modules [cli](cli) and [api-data-module](api-data-model).
This project acts as a maven reactor pom build. You can build at the top level to build the modules.

```shell script
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests=true
```

We suggest to build the project ignoring test execution (`-DskipTests=true`). It will run faster and avoid setting up a testing environment.

#### Running the CLI (dev mode)

You might use [quarkus cli](https://es.quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling) or [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
First, start a dotCMS instance locally. 
Then, execute the following commands

```shell script
# from top level to build all
cd cli
# command is same as the following to run the quarkus build plugin
# ../mvnw quarkus:dev 
quarkus dev
```
**NOTE:**  To reduce duplication in the multi-module project, mvnw is not included on each submodule.
The quarkus command finds the executable

To run mvnw from a submodule just use a relative path to the parent mvn.
If running from a submodule folder, all the dependencies will need to be up to date and installed to the local mvn with maven install

Alternatively, you can specify the subproject from the parent folder
```shell script
# from top level to build all
cd cli
# The command is same as the following to run the quarkus build plugin
# ../mvnw quarkus:dev 
../mvnw -pl cli quarkus:dev
```

Once the cli is launched in dev mode it'll print out a list of available commands.

followed by 

```shell script
--
Tests paused
Press [space] to restart, [e] to edit command line args (currently ''), [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [:] for the terminal, [h] for more options>
```

We can also instruct Quarkus dev mode to launch our cli using a preconfigured param by doing:
```shell script
../mvn quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args=status
```
This will launch the cli passing directly into it the arguments that tell them to execute the command status.

## Building a CLI jar 
In order to generate the cli as a jar packaged with all necessary dependencies you need to run the following command from the `cli` directory:
```shell script
../mvnw clean install package
```

All the commands can be executed directly from the generated jar which can be found under `cli/target/quarkus-app/`.

Example:
```shell script
java -jar ./cli/target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar status
```

## Logging

When running the CLI, a **_dotcms-cli.log_** file will be created in the directory where the CLI
executable is run.

#### File log level

To increase the file log level to _DEBUG_ when running in dev mode, use the following command:

```shell
../mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.log.file.level=DEBUG
```

#### Console log level

To increase the console log level to _DEBUG_ when running in dev mode, use the following command:

```shell
../mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.log.handler.console.\"DOTCMS_CONSOLE\".level=DEBUG
```

#### File log location

To override the default location of the log file, you have two options:

##### 1. Set the environment variable

Example:

```shell
export QUARKUS_LOG_FILE_PATH=/Users/my-user/CLI/dotcms-cli.log
java -jar cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar login -u admin@dotcms.com -p
```

##### 2. Set the system property

Example:

```shell
../mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.log.file.path=/Users/my-user/CLI/dotcms-cli.log
```

## CLI Instance Configuration

The CLI can be used to manage multiple dotCMS instances. Each instance profile is defined in the `~/.dotcms/dot-service.yml` file. 
Whatever profile is active will be used by the CLI to execute the commands.
The selected profile can be obtained by running the `status` command.
Here's an example of the default `dot-service.yml` file shipped with the CLI:

```yaml
- name: "default"
  credentials:
    user: "admin@dotcms.com"
- name: "demo"
  active: true
  credentials:
    user: "admin@dotCMS.com"
```

The profiles declared on this file are paired up with properties defined in an internal `application.properties` file.

```properties
# Your configuration properties
dotcms.client.servers.default=http://localhost:8080/api
dotcms.client.servers.demo=https://demo.dotcms.com/api
```

Notice how the `dotcms.client.servers` property has a suffix matching the profile name in the `dot-service.yml` file.

Therefore, in order to add a new instance profile, you need to add a new entry in the `dot-service.yml` file and a new property extending the `application.properties` file.
Application properties can be extended via system properties, environment variables, `.env` file or in `$PWD/config/application.properties` file.

To learn more about how to extend the `application.properties` file see the Quarkus configuration guide [Here](https://es.quarkus.io/guides/config-reference#application-properties-file) 

In future versions this process will be facilitated by the CLI itself.

### Workspace

The CLI needs a workspace to be able to pull and push content to a dotCMS instance. 
The workspace is basically a set of directories and files used to house and organize the different type of assets that can be managed by the CLI.
Additionally, a marker file called `.dot-workspace.yml` indicates to the CLI that the current directory is a valid workspace.
In the following table you can see the different directories and files that conform a workspace.

| File/Directory       | Type | Description             |
|----------------------|------|-------------------------|
| `content-types/`     | Dir  | Content-Types directory |
| `files/`             | Dir  | Files directory         |
| `languages/`         | Dir  | Languages Directory     |
| `sites/`             | Dir  | Sites Directory         |
| `.dot-workspace.yml` | File | CLI workspace marker    |

## GitHub Actions Integration
We provide support for GitHub Actions to be able to run the CLI as part of your CI/CD pipeline. 

The following example shows how to create a brand-new repository and seed it with a CLI workspace.
In order to incorporate the CLI into your GitHub Actions workflow, you need to:

- Create a GitHub Repository to manage your dotCMS assets.
- Copy the contents of the [action](./action) directory into your root project `.github/workflows` directory.
- In Your repository General Settings, enable the following permissions:
  -  Workflow Permissions : Read and Write permissions 
- In Your repository General Settings, Secrets and variables, Actions
  - Create a new variable called `DOT_API_URL` and set the value to a valid dotCMS URL. e.g. `https://demo.dotcms.com/api`
  ![How to create a variable](doc_images/create_variable.png)
  - Create a new secret called `DOT_TOKEN` and set the value to a valid dotCMS CLI token. 
  ![How to create a secret](doc_images/create_secret.png)
-  Seed your local repository with a CLI workspace
    * A cli workspace can be created by running any pull command e.g. `java -jar dotcli.jar files pull //demo.dotcms.com`  
    * Run any pull command from the root of your project see [examples](#examples) section.
    * A valid CLI workspace should contain a `.dot-workspace` file in the root of your project. Make sure to commit this file to your repository and the others that conform your workspace see the [workspace](#workspace) section. 
    * Commit and push the changes to your repository. 

- Now if the integration is successful, you should see a new commits made into your repository reflect in you dotCMS instance.

Here's an example of how a Git repository could look like after the GitHub Action has been integrated:

| File/Directory       | Type | Description               |
|----------------------|------|---------------------------|
| `.github/workflows/` | Dir  | GitHub Actions workflow   |
| `content-types/`     | Dir  | Content-Types directory   |
| `files/`             | Dir  | Files directory           |
| `languages/`         | Dir  | Languages Directory       |
| `sites/`             | Dir  | Sites Directory           |
| `.dot-workspace.yml` | File | CLI workspace marker      |
| `.gitignore`         | File | Git files exclude         |
| `README.md`          | File | Project readme            |
| `.env`               | File | Push command Options Spec |

- The default command executed by our GitHub Action is the global `push` 
- Global Push has different options. For more details to control the execution of the command see [Global Push](cli/docs/push.adoc) section for more details.
- Any additional Options required by the Global push command can be specified in the `.env` file in the following format `DOT_CLI_OPTS="--option1 --option2"`
So a valid example of a `.env` file could look like this `DOT_CLI_OPTS="--force --dry-run"`
```shell script
   DOT_CLI_OPTS=" --removeAssets --removeFolders --removeSites --removeContentTypes --removeLanguages --errors"
```
These options can cause data loss, so use them with caution. That's why they are not enabled by default.
Do not enable them unless you know what you are doing.
