# dotCMS CLI 

This project acts as a maven reactor pom build 
You can build at the top level to build all projects

To run individual services or quarkus dev mode cd to the module you want to run
making sure that dependencies have been installed first 

For running DotCMS CLI tests you need a whole backend environment compose by PostgreSQL database, Elasticsearch service and DotCMS instance. By default, tests are running using Testcontainers, although you can also disable containers and provide your own environment backend.

Before running tests, you need to set up the following environment variable:

```shell
# License file path is required to run tests (mandatory).
export DOTCMS_LICENSE_FILE=license_file_path.dat
```
And then you can run the build command, it will run all the tests, and it will install all the dependencies:
```shell script
# From top level to build all.
./mvnw -U clean install
```
In case we need to debug locally against a specific branch or revise the information stored in a local database, we can disable the Testcontainers as follow:

```shell script
# NOTE: If you disable the Testcontainers, you must provide the backend environment.
./mvnw -U clean install -Dtestcontainers.enabled=false
```


Skipping tests

```shell script
# From top level to build all.
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests=true
```

### To run cli.

You might use [quarkus cli](https://es.quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling) and [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) 

First Start a dotCMS instance locally

To run example API in dev mode
```shell script
# From top level to build all.
cd cli
../mvnw quarkus:dev
```
**NOTE:**  To reduce duplication in the multi-module project mvnw is not included in each submodule. 
The quarkus command finds the executable

To run mvnw from a submodule just use a relative path to the parent mvn
if running from the submodule folder all dependencies will need to be up to date and installed to the local mvn with maven install

Alternatively you can specify the sub project from the parent folder
```shell script
# from top level to build all
cd cli
# The command is same as the following to run the quarkus build plugin
# ../mvnw quarkus:dev 
../mvnw -pl cli quarkus:dev
```

quarkus:dev can only run a single project, but for other maven options you can choose to work out the dependencies to build and skip unrelated submodules
this uses the --am (also make) option.  In this way with the cli module will build the api-data-model but not build the rest-api module

```shell script
# From top level to build all
# The command is same as the following to run the quarkus build plugin
# ../mvnw quarkus:dev 
./mvnw -pl cli --am install
```


## Project outline

### api-data-model
This module implements the base API defined in api-data-model using JAX-RS to
provide a Rest interface for calling the api.   We make the rest classes call a delegate implementation
of the service interface,  we could make the resource class implement the service interface itself
but not doing so can provide some flexibility, e.g. you may not want all the public service methods to be rest calls
or you may need to do some special JAX-RS handling to implement the method.  
Any REST specific handling, e.g. authentication, Exception Mapping, Response object,  Streaming handling
can be done in here that are not concerns of the underlying java interface.

If the project using this allows for CDI it would be easy to add the API and inject the service implementations
Otherwise the owner will need to manage the annotation processing itself and methods will need to be created to allow manual injection of the implementation

### cli

This module uses picocli to easily create a client application

https://quarkus.io/guides/picocli
https://picocli.info/

The creation of individual subcommands becomes easy with picocli,  the current app demonstrates
some examples of what we can do.

#### LoginCommand
Shows example of getting a token from demo.cms.com and storing it in users personal secure storage

#### StatusCommand
Checks the token status against the server and returns current user object.

## Docker

## Configuration
Microprofile Configuration with quarkus makes configuration amazingly simple.   First place for all configuration
in the code is to look in the resources/application.properties file.

## Testing
[Testcontainers](http://testcontainers.com/getting-started/) is a library that provides easy and lightweight APIs for bootstrapping local development and test dependencies with real services wrapped in Docker containers. Using Testcontainers, you can write tests that depend on the same services you use in production without mocks or in-memory services.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
# Before packaging, make sure to provide the license file path. 
# Which one is mandatory to run the tests application.

export DOTCMS_LICENSE_FILE=license_file_path.dat

./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
# Before packaging, make sure to provide the license file path. 
# Which one is mandatory to run the tests application.

export DOTCMS_LICENSE_FILE=license_file_path.dat

./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

Skipping tests

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar -DskipTests=true
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
# Before packaging, make sure to provide the license file path. 
# Which one is mandatory to run the tests application.

export DOTCMS_LICENSE_FILE=license_file_path.dat

./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
# Before packaging, make sure to provide the license file path. 
# Which one is mandatory to run the tests application.

export DOTCMS_LICENSE_FILE=license_file_path.dat

./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

Skipping tests

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -DskipTests=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

## Provided Code

### RESTEasy Reactive

Easily start your Reactive RESTful Web Services

[Related guide section...](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-reactive#reactive-jax-rs-resources)

## Logging

When running the CLI, a **_dotcms-cli.log_** file will be created in the directory where the CLI
executable is run.

#### File log level

To increase the file log level to _DEBUG_ when running in dev mode, use the following command:

```shell
./mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.log.file.level=DEBUG
```

#### Console log level

To increase the console log level to _DEBUG_ when running in dev mode, use the following command:

```shell
./mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.log.handler.console.\"DOTCMS_CONSOLE\".level=DEBUG
```

#### File log location

To override the default location of the log file, you have two options:

##### 1. Set the environment variable

Example:

```shell
export QUARKUS_LOG_FILE_PATH=/Users/my-user/CLI/dotcms-cli.log
java -jar cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar login -u admin@dotcms.com -p admin
```

##### 2. Set the system property

Example:

```shell
./mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.log.file.path=/Users/my-user/CLI/dotcms-cli.log
```
