# .dotcliignore - Patterns for files and directories to exclude from push/pull operations
#
# This file uses glob patterns similar to .gitignore:
#   *       - matches any sequence of characters within a path segment
#   **      - matches any sequence of characters across path segments
#   ?       - matches any single character
#   []      - matches a character class
#   !       - negates a pattern (includes files that were previously excluded)
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored.
# Blank lines are also ignored.
# Patterns are evaluated relative to the workspace root.
