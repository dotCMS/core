# Database Connectivity Test

## Current Status Summary

✅ **Circuit breaker recovered successfully** at 09:46:51  
✅ **Health endpoint reports "healthy"**  
✅ **No database connection failures** since recovery  
✅ **4+ minutes since successful recovery**

## What to Check Next

### 1. Verify Database Operations Work

Try accessing any dotCMS page or admin interface:
```bash
# Test basic dotCMS responsiveness
curl -I http://localhost:8080/

# Test admin login page
curl -I http://localhost:8080/dotAdmin/

# Check if the application loads without database errors
```

### 2. Check Application-Level Symptoms

**What specific problems are you seeing?**
- Pages not loading?
- Admin interface not working?
- Specific error messages?
- Slow responses?

### 3. Test Actual Database Query

If you can access the dotCMS admin console, try:
1. **Content Browser** - can you see content?
2. **Site Browser** - can you navigate pages?
3. **User management** - can you view users?

### 4. Force a Small Database Operation

```bash
# This should work if database is truly recovered
docker exec df919f8a3ed5 curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/system/time"
```

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Connection Pool Still Has Stale Connections
Even though the circuit breaker recovered, the connection pool might still have some stale connections.

**Solution**: Connection pool should self-heal, but you could restart the container if needed.

### Issue 2: Application Cache Issues
Some application-level caches might still think the database is down.

**Solution**: Time or application restart should clear these.

### Issue 3: Different Database
If you restarted a different database instance or changed connection parameters, the application might be trying to connect to the wrong database.

## Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if dotCMS is actually responding to requests
docker exec df919f8a3ed5 curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/

# Check system status endpoint
docker exec df919f8a3ed5 curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/system/status 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Check for any ongoing errors in logs
docker logs df919f8a3ed5 2>&1 | grep -E "(ERROR|WARN)" | tail -5
```

## Next Steps

1. **Tell me what specific symptoms you're seeing** (pages not loading, errors, etc.)
2. **Try the verification commands above**
3. **If still having issues, we can force a complete circuit reset or check for other causes**

The circuit breaker **did recover successfully** - so if you're still seeing issues, it might be a different problem or cached state that needs to clear.
