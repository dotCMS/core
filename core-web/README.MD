## dotCMS core-web Monorepo

This monorepo, powered by [Nx](https://nx.dev), contains everything related to the frontend development for dotCMS.

### Installing Dependencies

Run `yarn install` to install all project dependencies.

### Development Server

To start the development server, run `nx serve dotcms-ui`. Visit [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files. We have set up a proxy to the backend server (on port 8080), allowing you to run both the backend server (by building the master branch or using Docker) and the frontend server simultaneously.

### Building the Project

We have three main applications to build:
- **dotcms-ui**: Run `nx build dotcms-ui`.
- **dotcms-block-editor**: Run `nx build dotcms-block-editor`.
- **dotcms-binary-field-builder**: Run `nx build dotcms-binary-field-builder`.

### Running Unit Tests

To run all unit tests for projects currently testable, use `yarn run test:dotcms`. To test a specific app or library, run `nx test {name-of-the-app-or-lib}`.

Use `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by recent changes.

### Understanding Your Workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of your projects' dependencies. This will help you better understand the structure and relationships in your monorepo.
