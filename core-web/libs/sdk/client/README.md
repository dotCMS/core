# @dotcms/client

`@dotcms/client` is the official dotCMS JavaScript library designed to simplify interactions with the DotCMS REST APIs.

This client library provides a streamlined, promise-based interface to fetch pages and navigation API.

## Features

- Easy-to-use methods to interact with the [DotCMS Page](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/page-rest-api-layout-as-a-service-laas) and [Navigation APIs](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/navigation-rest-api).
- Support for custom actions to communicate with the DotCMS page editor.
- Comprehensive TypeScript typings for better development experience.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @dotcms/client
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @dotcms/client
```

## Usage

First, initialize the client with your DotCMS instance details.

```javascript
import { dotcmsClient } from '@dotcms/client';

const client = dotcmsClient.init({
    dotcmsUrl: 'https://your-dotcms-instance.com',
    authToken: 'your-auth-token',
    siteId: 'your-site-id'
});
```

### Fetching a Page

Retrieve the elements of any page in your DotCMS system in JSON format.

```javascript
const pageData = await client.getPage({
    path: '/your-page-path',
    language_id: 1,
    personaId: 'optional-persona-id'
});

console.log(pageData);
```

### Fetching Navigation

Retrieve information about the DotCMS file and folder tree.

```javascript
const navData = await client.getNav({
    path: '/',
    depth: 2,
    languageId: 1
});

console.log(navData);
```
