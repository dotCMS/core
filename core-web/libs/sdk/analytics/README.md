# @dotcms/analytics

`@dotcms/analytics` is the official dotCMS JavaScript library for Content Analytics that helps track events and analytics in your webapps. Available for both browser and React applications.

## Features

-   **Simple Browser Integration**: Easy to implement via script tags using IIFE implementation
-   **React Support**: Built-in React components and hooks for seamless integration
-   **Event Tracking**: Simple API to track custom events with additional properties
-   **Automatic PageView**: Option to automatically track page views
-   **Debug Mode**: Optional debug logging for development

## Installation

```bash
npm install @dotcms/analytics
```

Or include the script in your HTML page:

```html
<script src="analytics.iife.js"></script>
```

## React Integration

### Provider Setup

Wrap your application with the `DotContentAnalyticsProvider`:

```tsx
// Example configuration
const analyticsConfig = {
    apiKey: 'your-api-key-from-dotcms-analytics-app',
    server: 'https://your-dotcms-instance.com',
    debug: false
};

function App() {
    return (
        <DotContentAnalyticsProvider config={analyticsConfig}>
            <YourApp />
        </DotContentAnalyticsProvider>
    );
}
```

### Tracking Custom Events

Use the `useAnalyticsTracker` hook to track custom events:

```tsx
function Activity({ title, urlTitle }) {
    const { track } = useAnalyticsTracker();

    const handleClick = () => {
        track('btn-click', {
            title,
            buttonText: 'Link to detail',
            urlTitle
        });
    };

    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Link to detail â†’</button>;
}
```

## Browser Configuration

The script can be configured using data attributes:

-   **data-analytics-server**: URL of the server where events will be sent
-   **data-analytics-debug**: Enables debug logging
-   **data-analytics-auto-page-view**: Enables automatic page view tracking
-   **data-analytics-key**: Required API key for authentication

```html
<!-- Example configuration -->
<script
    src="ca.min.js"
    data-analytics-server="http://localhost:8080"
    data-analytics-key="dev-key-123"
    data-analytics-auto-page-view
    data-analytics-debug></script>

<!-- Without automatic tracking - events must be sent manually -->
<script
    src="ca.min.js"
    data-analytics-server="http://localhost:8080"
    data-analytics-debug
    data-analytics-key="dev-key-123"></script>
```
