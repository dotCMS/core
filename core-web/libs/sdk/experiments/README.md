## How A/B Testing Works with @dotcms/experiments

The A/B testing process with `@dotcms/experiments` is designed to be straightforward and automatic:

1. **Experiment Assignment**: When a user visits a page that includes an experiment, the library first checks if the user has been assigned to an experiment variant. If not, it queries DotCMS Analytics to determine if there are active experiments and assigns the user to the appropriate variant.

2. **Page Redirection**: If the user's assigned variant differs from the current page, the library automatically redirects the user to the correct variant page. This ensures that the user experiences the variant they have been assigned to.

3. **Tracking Pageviews**: After redirection or upon visiting the page, the library sends a pageview event to DotCMS Analytics. This data is used to determine the effectiveness of each variant, ultimately helping to identify which variant performs better in the A/B test.
