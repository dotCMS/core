# dotCMS Experiments SDK

The `@dotcms/experiments` SDK is the official dotCMS JavaScript library that helps add A/B testing to your web applications. It handles user assignments to different variants of a page and tracks their interactions.

## Overview

### When to Use It

-   Adding A/B testing capabilities to your web application
-   Running experiments to optimize user experience
-   Testing different page variants with real users
-   Tracking experiment performance with DotCMS Analytics

### Key Features

-   **User Assignment to Experiments**: Automatically assigns users to different experimental variants, ensuring diverse user experiences and reliable test data
-   **Link Verification for Redirection**: Checks links to ensure users are redirected to their assigned experiment variant, maintaining the integrity of the testing process
-   **Automatic PageView Event Sending**: Automatically sends PageView events to DotCMS Analytics, enabling real-time tracking of user engagement and experiment effectiveness

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @dotcms/experiments
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @dotcms/experiments
```

## Getting Started

### `withExperiments` Higher-Order Component

The SDK exports a single HOC (Higher-Order Component) called `withExperiments` that wraps your page component with experiment functionality. This component handles:

-   User assignment to experiment variants
-   Automatic redirection to the correct variant
-   Prevention of content flickering during variant loading
-   Automatic page view tracking to dotCMS Analytics
-   Click event handling to maintain variant consistency across navigation

### Configuration Object

The `config` object passed to `withExperiments` accepts the following properties:

-   **apiKey** (required): Your API key from the DotCMS Analytics app
-   **server** (required): The URL of your dotCMS instance (e.g., `https://your-dotcms-instance.com`)
-   **redirectFn** (optional): Custom redirect function for SPA navigation (default: `window.location.replace`)
-   **trackPageView** (optional): Enable/disable automatic page view tracking (default: `true`)
-   **debug** (optional): Enable debug logging in the browser console (default: `false`)

## Usage

### With @dotcms/react (Recommended)

The recommended approach is to wrap the `DotCMSLayoutBody` component with `withExperiments`. The pattern supports **conditional wrapping** - experiments are only enabled when an API key is configured:

```javascript
"use client";

import { withExperiments } from "@dotcms/experiments";
import { DotCMSLayoutBody, useEditableDotCMSPage } from "@dotcms/react";
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

// Experiment configuration - only applied if apiKey is present
const experimentConfig = {
    apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPERIMENTS_API_KEY,
    server: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DOTCMS_HOST,
    debug: true
};

export function Page({ pageContent }) {
    const { pageAsset } = useEditableDotCMSPage(pageContent);
    const { replace } = useRouter();

    // Conditionally wrap with experiments if apiKey is configured
    const DotCMSLayoutBodyComponent = experimentConfig.apiKey
        ? withExperiments(DotCMSLayoutBody, {
              ...experimentConfig,
              redirectFn: replace
          })
        : DotCMSLayoutBody;

    return (
        <main>
            <DotCMSLayoutBodyComponent
                page={pageAsset}
                components={pageComponents}
            />
        </main>
    );
}
```

> ðŸ“š **Learn more about `DotCMSLayoutBody`**: See the [@dotcms/react SDK documentation](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/blob/main/core-web/libs/sdk/react/README.md#dotcmslayoutbody) for complete details on configuring the layout renderer, component mapping, and available props.

### Configuration Best Practices

-   **Use Environment Variables**: Store your API key and server URL in environment variables
-   **Conditional Wrapping**: Only enable experiments when an API key is configured using a ternary operator
-   **Framework Router**: Pass your framework's router function (e.g., `router.replace` for Next.js) to maintain SPA navigation
-   **Debug Mode**: Enable debug logging during development to troubleshoot experiment assignment issues

### How It Works

Once you wrap your component with `withExperiments`, the SDK automatically handles:

1. **User Assignment**: Assigns users to experiment variants when they visit a page with an active experiment
2. **Automatic Redirection**: Redirects users to their assigned variant URL (prevents seeing the wrong variant)
3. **Flicker Prevention**: Hides content during redirection to avoid showing the wrong variant momentarily
4. **Navigation Handling**: Maintains variant consistency when users click links
5. **Analytics Tracking**: Sends pageview events to DotCMS Analytics automatically

All of this happens behind the scenes - you just need to wrap your component and provide the configuration.
