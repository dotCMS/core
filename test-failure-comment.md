# Test Failure Comment Feature

This file tests the enhanced workflow's failure comment feature.

## New Feature Added
When the workflow fails to find an issue link, it now:
1. Still fails the workflow (maintains security)
2. **Adds a helpful comment to the PR** with fix instructions

## Expected Behavior
Branch name: `test-failure-comment-feature` (no issue pattern)

The workflow should:
1. ❌ **Fail** - No issue patterns found
2. 📝 **Add comment** to PR with comprehensive fix instructions:
   - Option 1: Link via GitHub UI (Development section)
   - Option 2: Add keyword to PR body (`fixes #123`)
   - Option 3: Use branch naming (`issue-123-feature`)
   - Explanation of why issue linking is required

## Benefits
- **Better UX**: Users get clear instructions in the PR itself
- **Actionable**: Multiple specific options to resolve the issue
- **Visible**: Comment appears directly in PR conversation
- **Educational**: Explains why issue linking is important

## Test Success Criteria
- ✅ Workflow fails with exit code 1
- ✅ Comment appears on this PR with fix instructions
- ✅ Comment includes all 3 fix options
- ✅ Comment explains why issue linking is required
- ✅ Comment has clear formatting and helpful tone

Branch: test-failure-comment-feature
