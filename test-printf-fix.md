# Test Printf YAML Fix

This file tests the final YAML syntax fix using printf instead of multiline strings.

## YAML Issue Resolution
The problem was multiline string literals in YAML causing parsing errors.

## Final Fix Applied
Changed from multiline string:
```bash
comment_body='## ‚ùå Issue Linking Required

This PR could not be linked...'
```

To printf with proper formatting:
```bash
comment_body=$(printf "%s\n\n%s\n\n%s..." \
  "## ‚ùå Issue Linking Required" \
  "This PR could not be linked to an issue..." \
  "### How to fix this:")
```

## Expected Results
Branch: `test-printf-yaml-fix` (no issue pattern)

1. ‚úÖ **YAML validation passes** - No syntax errors
2. ‚ùå **Workflow fails** - No issue found  
3. üìù **Comment added** with proper formatting:
   - Clear headers with emoji
   - Bulleted lists
   - Code examples
   - Professional formatting

This should finally resolve the YAML parsing issue and demonstrate the complete failure comment feature.

Branch: test-printf-yaml-fix
Expected: Clean YAML validation + helpful failure comment
