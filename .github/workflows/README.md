## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Developers

**Understanding Workflow Failures:**
1. Check the failed workflow run in GitHub Actions
2. Look for the failed phase (Initialize, Build, Test, etc.)
3. Review logs for specific errors
4. See [Troubleshooting Guide](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#troubleshooting-guide) for common issues

**Creating a PR:**
- Your PR triggers `cicd_1-pr.yml` automatically
- Only runs tests for changed components (via filters)
- Must pass before merge queue entry
- See [PR Check Flow](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#1-pr-check-workflow-cicd_1-pryml) diagram

**Merging a PR:**
- Enters merge queue → `cicd_2-merge-queue.yml`
- Runs ALL tests to catch flaky issues
- Success → auto-merge to main
- Failure blocks all PRs behind it in queue

### For Release Managers

**Triggering a Release:**
1. Navigate to Actions → `-6 Release Process`
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter release version (e.g., `24.12.31-01`)
4. Configure options (usually keep defaults)
5. Monitor progress in workflow run

See [How to Trigger a Release](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#how-to-trigger-a-release) for details.

### For DevOps/Maintainers

**Adding a New Test Suite:**
1. Update `test-matrix.yml` with new configuration
2. No workflow changes needed!
3. Matrix auto-generates and parallelizes

**Modifying Workflows:**
1. Check if change belongs in a reusable phase
2. Test in PR workflow first
3. Document changes in this README

See [Maintenance Guide](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#maintenance) for more.

## 📊 Workflow Overview

### Main CI/CD Pipeline (6 Workflows)

| # | Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **PR Check** | PR opened/updated | Fast validation of changes |
| 2 | **Merge Queue** | PR ready to merge | Comprehensive testing |
| 3 | **Trunk** | Push to main | Deploy snapshots, build CLI |
| 4 | **Nightly** | 3:18 AM daily | Comprehensive validation |
| 5 | **LTS** | Push to release-* | LTS branch validation |
| 6 | **Release** | Manual trigger | Official releases |

### Standard Phase Pattern

All workflows follow this pattern:
```
Initialize → Build → Test → (Semgrep) → (CLI Build) → (Deploy) → Finalize → Report
```

See [Architecture Diagram](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#architecture-diagram) for complete relationships.

## File Structure

GitHub only allows workflows in `.github/workflows/` (no subfolders). We use a folder-like naming convention:

**Format**: `category_subcategory_name.yml`
- Example: `cicd/comp/build-phase.yml` → `cicd_comp_build-phase.yml`

**Prefixes**:
- **Numbers (1-6)**: Main CICD workflows in PR progression order
- **Dash prefix (-)**: Ensures top placement in GitHub UI (e.g., `-1 PR Check`)

**Actions**: Can use subfolders (`.github/actions/category/action-name/`)

See [File Naming Convention](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#file-naming-convention) for details.

## Critical Information

⚠️ **Security Rules**:
- PR workflows run on **untrusted code** - never use secrets
- Secrets unavailable for fork PRs
- Use `cicd_post-workflow-reporting.yml` for notifications requiring secrets

⚠️ **Job Naming Rules**:
- First job: `"Initialize / Initialize"` 
- Last job: `"Finalize / Final Status"`
- These names signal workflow status to GitHub Checks
- Changing them breaks check detection (workflows hang until timeout)

⚠️ **Workflow Design**:
- Don't create duplicate workflows for same trigger
- Extend existing workflows instead
- Leverage reusable phase workflows
- Follow the standard phase pattern 

## Architecture Overview

Our CI/CD uses a **three-tier architecture** for modularity and maintainability:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Top-Level Workflows (6)                             │
│  cicd_1-pr.yml, cicd_2-merge-queue.yml, etc.       │
│  • Define triggers and orchestration                 │
│  • Call reusable phases                              │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Reusable Phase Workflows (10)                       │
│  Initialize, Build, Test, Deploy, etc.              │
│  • Shared business logic                             │
│  • Used by multiple top-level workflows             │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Composite Actions (15+)                             │
│  maven-job, setup-java, deploy-docker, etc.        │
│  • Atomic operations                                 │
│  • Reusable across all workflows                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**: 70% less code duplication, consistent behavior, easier maintenance.

See [Architecture Diagram](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#architecture-diagram) for complete visualization.

## Top-Level Workflows

Located in `.github/workflows/cicd_*.yml`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Duration | Key Features |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **1-PR** | PR open/update | 15-25 min | Selective tests, no secrets, fast feedback |
| **2-Merge Queue** | Ready to merge | 30-45 min | ALL tests, catches flaky tests |
| **3-Trunk** | Push to main | 20-30 min | Artifact reuse, CLI builds, snapshots |
| **4-Nightly** | 3:18 AM daily | 45-60 min | Trunk health monitor, early breakage detection |
| **5-LTS** | Push to release-* | 30-45 min | LTS branch validation |
| **6-Release** | Manual | 25-35 min | Production release, full deployment |

Each orchestrates the process by calling reusable phases and actions.

See [Workflow Configurations](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#workflow-configurations-path-to-main-branch) for detailed comparison.

## Reusable Workflow Phases

Located in `.github/workflows/cicd_comp_*-phase.yml`:

| Phase | Purpose | Outputs |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Initialize** | Detect changes, check for reusable artifacts | `found_artifacts`, `backend`, `frontend`, `build` |
| **Build** | Compile code, generate artifacts | `maven-repo` artifact |
| **Test** | Matrix-driven parallel test execution | Test results, build reports |
| **Semgrep** | Security and code quality scanning | Quality gate status |
| **CLI Build** | Multi-platform native CLI builds | CLI artifacts (Linux, macOS x2) |
| **Deployment** | Docker images, NPM packages, Artifactory | Docker tags, NPM versions |
| **Release Prepare** | Version validation, branch creation | Release version, tag, branch |
| **Release** | Artifactory, Javadocs, SBOM, labels | Release artifacts |
| **Finalize** | Aggregate results, determine status | `aggregate_status` |
| **Reporting** | Generate reports, send notifications | Slack messages, test reports |

**Key Principle**: Each phase can be independently configured and reused across different workflows.

See [Detailed Flow Diagrams](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#detailed-flow-diagrams) for visual representation.

## Workflow Configurations

Each workflow has specific optimizations and purposes:

### 1-PR (Pull Request Validation)
**Optimization**: Speed & Safety
- ✅ Selective testing (filters.yaml determines what runs)
- ❌ No secrets (unreviewed code)
- ⚡ Fast feedback (15-25 min typical)
- 📊 Post-workflow reporting (separate workflow with secrets)

### 2-Merge Queue (Pre-Merge Validation)  
**Optimization**: Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ ALL tests run (catches flaky tests)
- ✅ Tests combined code (includes PRs ahead in queue)
- ⚠️ Failures block all developers (monitor closely!)
- 🔒 Commit SHA matches future main HEAD

### 3-Trunk (Post-Merge Deployment)
**Optimization**: Artifact Reuse
- ♻️ Reuses merge queue artifacts (saves 5-10 min)
- 🔨 Native CLI builds (3 platforms)
- 📦 Snapshot deployments (GitHub, Artifactory)
- 📚 Optional SDK publishing

### 4-Nightly (Trunk Health Monitor)
**Optimization**: Early Problem Detection  
- 🩺 Monitors trunk health (NOT release gate)
- 🚨 Catches breakage before changes accumulate
- 🎯 Critical for CI success & release frequency
- 🌙 Runs at 3:18 AM daily
- 🧪 Long-running tests (impractical for PRs)

### 5-LTS (LTS Branch Validation)
**Optimization**: Long-Term Support
- 🔖 Triggered on release-* branches
- ✅ Full test suite
- 📋 Version-specific configuration

### 6-Release (Production Release)
**Optimization**: Complete Deployment
- 🚀 Manual trigger only
- 📦 Full artifact deployment
- 🏷️ GitHub label management
- 📝 Complete documentation

See [Workflow Configurations Table](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#workflow-configurations-path-to-main-branch) for detailed comparison.

## Release Promotion Strategy

**Goal**: Keep main branch always releasable while allowing thorough validation before official releases.

**Philosophy**: 
- PR validation prevents unreleasable commits
- Additional testing happens without blocking development  
- Promotion branches get version changes only (minimal, reproducible)
- Fixes flow through normal PR process (no cherry-picking)

**Release Promotion Flow**:
```
PR → Merge Queue → Main → Manual QA/Smoke Testing (Required) → RC → Release
```

**Trunk Health Monitoring** (Parallel, Not in Promotion Flow):
```
Main → Nightly Tests (3:18 AM) → Alert on Failures
```

**Key Points:**
- **Release Path**: Manual QA/Smoke testing is **always required** before RC
- **Nightly Tests**: Legacy workflow, **NOT part of release promotion**
  - Purpose: Early detection of trunk breakage
  - Critical: Prevents change accumulation (easier debugging)
  - Result: Enabled increased release frequency over recent years
- Each release promotion step increases confidence without blocking development

See [Release Promotion Process](WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md#release-promotion-process) for detailed diagrams and examples.
