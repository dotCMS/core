# GitHub Actions Workflow for LTS Auto-run Tests
# This file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration for running automated tests on long-term support (LTS) branches.
# It defines a series of jobs that are triggered on pushes to branches matching the pattern release-*. The workflow includes the following jobs:
# Initialize: Sets up the environment and performs initial validation.
# Build: Compiles the project if no artifacts were found during initialization.
# Test: Runs various tests (unit, integration, frontend, etc.) based on the outputs from the initialization step.
# Finalize: Aggregates and finalizes the results from the previous jobs.
# The workflow uses concurrency control to manage multiple runs and cancels in-progress runs for the same branch or pull request to prevent delays.
