# PR Checks Workflow
#
# This workflow is triggered on pull requests to the main branch and orchestrates
# the entire PR check process. It uses reusable workflows to modularize different
# stages of the CI process.
#
# Key features:
# - Triggered on PR open and synchronize events
# - Uses concurrency to manage multiple runs
# - Modular structure using reusable workflows
# - Conditional execution based on initialization results
# - Comprehensive PR checks including build, tests, and Semgrep analysis
# - Final status notification
#
# Security Note:
#  As PR checks are run on code that
#  is not yet merged into the main branch, we should not add anything that requires secrets
#  post-workflow-reporting is triggered to run after this workflow unlike the other workflow and can handle any notifications like slack
#  that require secrets. That workflow cannot be modified by PRs until they are merged.
