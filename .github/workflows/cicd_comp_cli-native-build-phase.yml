# CLI Native Build Phase Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow is responsible for building native images of the CLI tool
# for different operating systems. It can be configured to build for multiple platforms
# or just for Linux, depending on the input parameters.
#
# Due to the extra runner requirements and extra cost of macOS runners, the workflow is currently run only after merging to main
# We may change this or test a single native build before this stage in the future for extra coverage.
# Native builds should not act different based upon changes to core server so we should be able to restrict these builds/tests
# to only run on changes to the CLI tool.
#
# Key features:
# - Configurable native image building based on input
# - Dynamic OS matrix generation for multi-platform builds
# - Artifact upload for each built distribution
# - Reusable Maven job action for consistent build environment setup
# - Artifact reuse from previous workflow runs
