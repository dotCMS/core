# Trunk Checks Workflow
#
# This workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch or manually via workflow_dispatch.
# It orchestrates a comprehensive set of checks, builds, tests, and deployments for the trunk (main) branch.
#
# Key features:
# - Triggered on push to main or manual dispatch
# - Configurable options for reusing previous builds and running all tests
# - Comprehensive checks including build, tests, SonarQube analysis, and CLI artifact building
# - Deployment to the trunk environment
# - Final reporting of the workflow status
