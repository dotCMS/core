# Area Label Mapping
#
# Maps dorny/paths-filter keys (from filters.yaml) to GitHub labels.
# Only filters listed here will have labels applied to PRs.
#
# How it works:
# 1. When a PR is opened/updated, dorny/paths-filter checks which filters match
# 2. The 'changes' output contains a JSON array of matched filter names
# 3. This config maps those filter names to GitHub label names
# 4. Labels are applied to the PR (duplicates are skipped)
#
# To add a new area label:
# 1. Add the filter pattern to filters.yaml (under "# PR area labeling filters")
# 2. Add the mapping below (filter_key: "Label Name")
# 3. Create the label in GitHub with matching name and color
#
# Notes:
# - Not all filters need labels (e.g., 'build', 'jvm_unit_test' are for CI logic only)
# - A PR can have multiple area labels if it touches multiple areas
# - Labels use "Area : " prefix to distinguish from feature labels ("dotCMS : ")

# Filter key -> Label name
