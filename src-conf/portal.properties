    # deployed with the context root at "/" while the web application by the
    # name of "portal-web" is deployed with the context root at "/portal". The
    # web application at "/" is lean and doesn't contain any actual JSPs, but
    # uses the JSPs and resources found at "/portal".
    #
    # Another web application deployed with the context root at "/another" could
    # also be its own portal instance by reusing the resources found at
    # "/portal". This allows one server to host multiple instances of the portal
