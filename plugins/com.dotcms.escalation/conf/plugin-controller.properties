##The plugin-controller is for specific dotCMS plugin configuration.  Usually this file is intended for 
##dotCMS plugin developers to do things like add custom hooks or control the cms filter. All the 
##possible properties are listed in the hello.world sample.
##Typically plugin specific configuration is done in the plugin.properties. 
##This is where a plugin specifies its own properties 

##This is for sevlets. A plugin can add exclusions so that the filter will not fire on them and redirect away
