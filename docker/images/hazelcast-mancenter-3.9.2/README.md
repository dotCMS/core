We encourage you to use the image provided at https://hub.docker.com/r/dotcms/hazelcast-mancenter/ rather than building your own image.  

Building custom images may create more complexity and challenges as it relates to the ongoing support of your installation.  Please contact support@dotcms.com to inquire about add-on product services available for extended support around Docker.  

dotCMS has architected this image to handle many different use cases, providing the best dotCMS product experience while still enabling use of custom functionality with the genuine dotCMS image.

Please send any thoughts or suggestions to improve our docker image to support@dotcms.com.

If you feel you must create your own custom docker image(s), please contact dotCMS Support to discuss product compatibility and scope-of-support concerns prior to implementation.
