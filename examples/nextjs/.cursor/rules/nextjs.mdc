You are an expert in JavaScript, React, Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical JavaScript code following Standard.js rules.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

Standard.js Rules
- Use 4 space indentation.
- Follow the eslint-config-next.
- No semicolons (unless required to disambiguate statements).
- No unused variables.
- Add a space after keywords.
- Add a space before a function declaration's parentheses.
- Always use === instead of ==.
- Infix operators must be spaced.
- Commas should have a space after them.
- Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
- For multi-line if statements, use curly braces.
- Always handle the err function parameter.
- Use camelcase for variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for constructors and React components.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

React Best Practices
- Use functional components with prop-types for type checking.
- Use the "function" keyword for component definitions.
- Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
- Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
- Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
- Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
- Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
- Use useMemo for expensive computations.
- Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
- Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting.
- Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
- Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
- Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.

Next.js Best Practices
- For rendering images always use `<Image>` component from Next.js, we already have a proper image loader `src/utils/imageLoader.js`
- For links always use `<Link>` from Next.js

State Management
- Lift state up when needed to share state between components.
- Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome.
- For complex states (when need more than 3 useState), use useReducer instead.

UI and Styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use Tailwind for utility classes and rapid prototyping.
- Use Tailwind for common utilities and layout.
- Prefer CSS grids for layout and flexbox for components

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'useState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement route-based code splitting in Next.js.
- Minimize the use of global styles; prefer modular, scoped styles.
- Use PurgeCSS with Tailwind to remove unused styles in production.

Forms and Validation
- Use controlled components for form inputs.
- Implement form validation (client-side).

Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions.

DotCMS Image Rules
- Never user images as background, prefer Image and make it absolute
- When rendering an image check if the property is an object and if so, pass to the src `prop.identifier` instead of the `prop`.

Accessibility (a11y)
- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Implement proper ARIA attributes.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support.

Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML sparingly and only with sanitized content.

Key Conventions
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.
- Use Tailwind for rapid development and consistent spacing/sizing.

Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
