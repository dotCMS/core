INSTALL
-------

In order to install this bundle:

1) 	If you are running from source, make sure you have built and deployed the dotCMS 
	BEFORE trying to build this plugin.  To do this, from the ROOT of dotCMS, execute the 
	"deploy" task of the build.xml ant file to create the standard dotcms_xx.jar file, e.g.
	
		ant deploy
		
	This will build the monolithic dotCMS .jar with the libraries needed to build OSGi plugins 
	and place it in the dotCMS/WEB-INF/lib directory.
		
2) 	From this directory (ROOT of the plugin), execute the "build" task of the build.xml ant 
	file to create the bundle jar file.
	
3) 	From this directory (ROOT of the plugin), execute the "deploy" task of the build.xml 
	ant file in order to move the generated jar by the "build" task inside the Felix OSGI container 
	(dotCMS/felix/load).
	
To uninstall this bundle:

1) 	From this directory (ROOT of the plugin), execute the "undeploy" task of the build.xml ant file 
	in order to remove the bundle jar file from the Felix OSGI container (dotCMS/felix/load).
