INSTALL
-------

In order to install this bundle:

1) 	If you are running from source, make sure you have built and deployed the dotCMS 
	BEFORE trying to build this plugin.  To do this, from the ROOT of dotCMS, execute the 
	"deploy" task of the build.xml ant file to create the standard dotcms_xx.jar file, e.g.
	
		ant deploy
		
	This will build the monolithic dotCMS .jar with the libraries needed to build OSGi plugins 
	and place it in the dotCMS/WEB-INF/lib directory.
		
2) 	From this directory (ROOT of the plugin), execute the "build" task of the build.xml ant 
	file to create the bundle jar file.

3)  In order to run this example is required to modify the exposed packages to the OSGI context from dotCMS.
    That is possible using the dotCMS UI (CMS Admin->Dynamic Plugins->Exported Packages), the complete working list
    for this example is under the "conf" folder under the ROOT of the plugin. Please just replace the current content
    with the one found in the: plugin ROOT/conf/osgi-extra.conf file.
    What we did with the expose packages list was to remove the Spring references in order to use the Spring libraries inside
    our plugin and not the ones provide by dotCMS and avoiding problems with multiple versions of Spring classes.

To install this bundle:

    1) Copy the bundle jar file inside the Felix OSGI container (dotCMS/felix/load).
        OR
    2) Upload the bundle jar file using the dotCMS UI (CMS Admin->Dynamic Plugins->Upload Plugin).
	
To uninstall this bundle:

    1) Remove the bundle jar file from the Felix OSGI container (dotCMS/felix/load).
        OR
    2) Undeploy the bundle using the dotCMS UI (CMS Admin->Dynamic Plugins->Undeploy).
