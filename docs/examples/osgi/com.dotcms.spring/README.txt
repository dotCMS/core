This bundle plugin is an example of how to add Spring support to a bundle plugin, creates
and registers a simple Spring Controller.

How to create a bundle plugin with Spring support
-------------------------------------------

--
In order to create this OSGI plugin, you must write the META-INF/MANIFEST
to be inserted into OSGI jar.

In this MANIFEST you must specify (see template plugin):

Bundle-Name: The name of your bundle

Bundle-SymbolicName: A short an unique name for the bundle

Bundle-Activator: Package and name of your Activator class (example: com.dotmarketing.osgi.spring.Activator)

DynamicImport-Package: *
    Dynamically add required imports the plugin may need without add them explicitly

Import-Package: This is a comma separated list of package's name.
                In this list there must be the packages that you are using inside
                the bundle plugin and that are exported by the dotCMS runtime.
                (Note Spring package)

Beware!!!
---------

In order to work inside the Apache Felix OSGI runtime, the import
and export directive must be bidirectional.

The DotCMS must declare the set of packages that will be available
to the OSGI plugins by changing the property:
felix.org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra
inside the configuration file src-conf/dotmarketing-config.properties

Only after that exported packages are defined in this list,
a plugin can Import the packages to use them inside the OSGI blundle.

com.dotmarketing.osgi.spring.ExampleController
-----------------------------------------------

Simple annotated Spring Controller.

--
example-servlet.xml
----------------------------------------

Standard Spring configuration file where basically we enabled the support for anntotation-driven controllers.

--
Activator
---------

This bundle activator extends from com.dotmarketing.osgi.GenericBundleActivator and implements BundleActivator.start().
Will manually register making use of the class DispatcherServlet our spring configuration file (example-servlet.xml).

* PLEASE note the "publishBundleServices( context )" call, this call is MANDATORY (!) as it will allow us to share resources
  between the bundle and the host container (dotcms) required to a fully Spring integration with dotcms.

Testing
-------

The Spring controller is registered under the url pattern "/spring" can be test it running and assuming your dotcms url is localhost:8080:
    http://localhost:8080/app/spring/examplecontroller
    http://localhost:8080/app/spring/examplecontroller/Testing
