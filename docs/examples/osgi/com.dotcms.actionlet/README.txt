This bundle plugin is an example of how to add dotcms WorkFlowActionlet classes with our bundle plugin.

How to add a Actionlet OSGI plugin
---------------------------------

--
In order to create this OSGI plugin, you must write the META-INF/MANIFEST
to be inserted into OSGI jar.

In this MANIFEST you must specify (see template plugin):

Bundle-Name: The name of your bundle

Bundle-SymbolicName: A short an unique name for the bundle

Bundle-Activator: Package and name of your Activator class (example: com.dotmarketing.osgi.actionlet.Activator)

DynamicImport-Package: *
    Dynamically add required imports the plugin may need without add them explicitly

Import-Package: This is a comma separated list of package's name.
                In this list there must be the packages that you are using inside
                the bundle plugin and that are exported by the dotCMS runtime.

Beware!!!
---------

In order to work inside the Apache Felix OSGI runtime, the import
and export directive must be bidirectional.

The DotCMS must declare the set of packages that will be available to
the OSGI plugins by changing the file: dotCMS/WEB-INF/felix/osgi-extra.conf.
This is possible also using the dotCMS UI (CMS Admin->Dynamic Plugins->Exported Packages).

Only after that exported packages are defined in this list,
a plugin can Import the packages to use them inside the OSGI blundle.

-----------------------------------------------

Implementation of a WorkFlowActionlet object.

Activator
---------

This bundle activator extends from com.dotmarketing.osgi.GenericBundleActivator and implements BundleActivator.start().
This activator will allow you to register the WorkFlowActionlet object using the GenericBundleActivator.registerActionlet method
